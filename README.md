Create the measurements file with `python create_measurements.py 1000000000`. **Attention: the generated file has a size of approx. 15 GB, so make sure to have enough disk space.**

To test your implementation create a file named `calculate_average_${yournamehere}.sh` and make it executable.

Then you can run the test with:

(Running this deletes the generated measurements.txt file so make sure to back it up or you'll need to regenerate it)
```sh
./test.sh yournamehere
```
